root's original password is "tangleisawesome", and beekeeper's is "pollen2honey" (both without quotation marks).

Preshared passwords are extremely unsafe. honeycombOS mitigates that with the following:

- You are forced to change the password for beekeeper as soon as you log in.
- You are not be able to SSH in as root.

After you change the password for beekeeper, make sure you also change for root:

$ sudo su
# passwd

As guidelines for password creation:
- Don't use the same password for beekeeper and root.
- Make sure the passwords have 12 characters or more, including:
   - lower and upper case letters
   - numbers
   - special characters
